## Executive Summary

This project focuses on enhancing financial forecasting and resource utilization within the telecom industry. By analyzing historical revenue data and applying forecasting techniques, the analysis aims to address critical inefficiencies in revenue projections and financial planning. The goal is to enable more accurate predictions and actionable insights for strategic financial decision-making.

## Project Objective  
To improve the accuracy of revenue forecasting and optimize financial planning processes. The project identifies forecasting errors, evaluates model performance using MAPE and other metrics, and recommends actions to enhance financial accuracy across product and regional dimensions.

---

## Methodology Overview

The analysis follows a structured, step-by-step methodology to improve revenue forecasting accuracy and support strategic financial planning:

- **Business Understanding:** Identified key challenges, including inaccurate revenue projections and underutilized financial resources, with a focus on improving revenue forecasting models.
- **Data Accessing & Data Quality Review:** Collected relevant telecom financial datasets and conducted a thorough review of data quality, including checks for missing values, duplicates, errors, inconsistencies, and outliers that could impact the accuracy of forecasting analysis.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Applied Power Query to clean and transform the data, using grouping, pivoting, and other necessary techniques to structure it effectively for analysis.
- **Data Analysis & Modeling:** Performed revenue forecasting at overall, product, and regional levels. Model performance was evaluated using the following error metrics:
  - **Absolute Error (ABS)**
  - **Percentage Error**
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
- **Forecast Evaluation:** Interpreted forecast accuracy based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) ranges, with corresponding recommendations:
  - **MAPE < 10%:** Highly accurate forecast — no major adjustments needed.
  - **10% ≤ MAPE < 20%:** Reasonably accurate forecast — fine-tuning advised.
  - **MAPE ≥ 20%:** Inaccurate forecast — significant model adjustments required.
- **Data Visualization:** Developed a line chart to illustrate sales trends by product over time, enhancing insight clarity for strategic decision-making.
- **Reporting & Communication:** Summarized key findings and recommendations to guide stakeholders in refining financial planning and resource allocation.

## Project Overview

This section provides a high-level overview of the analytical workflow and deliverables for the telecom financial forecasting project. It demonstrates how raw revenue and operational data were processed, analyzed, and visualized to generate actionable insights that support financial planning and revenue optimization.

### Working of Data Analyzing & Modeling

Forecasting was conducted at multiple levels—including overall revenue, product categories, and regional segments—using metrics such as Absolute Error (ABS), Percentage Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to evaluate accuracy and guide model refinement.

## Reporting and Communication

### Key Findings

- **Sales Trend Analysis (2021–2023):** Identified notable seasonal peaks, particularly mid-year, indicating strong seasonality in sales patterns.

- **Forecasting Accuracy:** Observed significant Absolute Errors (ABS) in January and February. Overall, MAPE analysis suggests the forecasting model is reasonably accurate.

- **Product-Level Sales Performance:** Broadband and Mobile Plans are the primary revenue drivers.

- **Regional-Level Sales Performance:** Yangon leads sales contributions, followed by Mandalay and Naypyidaw.

### Recommendations

- **Establish a Forecast Monitoring Process:** Develop a comparison dashboard (Excel, Power BI, Tableau) for regular updates of actual vs. forecasted sales. Implement monthly or quarterly reviews to track forecast accuracy.

- **Optimize Product Portfolio:** Focus on upselling and cross-selling value-added services related to Mobile Plans and Broadband, such as higher-tier data packages and bundles.

- **Expand in Underperforming Regions:** Target marketing efforts and network upgrades in these areas. Analyze customer preferences and competitor activity to tailor offerings and increase market share.

- **Seasonal Campaign Planning:** Leverage seasonal sales spikes with strategic promotions, bundled deals, and limited-time offers to maximize revenue.

### Next Actions

- Develop forecasting monitoring dashboard  
- Conduct detailed product-level segmentation analysis  
- Perform regional market assessment  
- Evaluate campaign performance metrics
